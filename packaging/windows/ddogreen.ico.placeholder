# Basic Windows icon placeholder
# Note: This is a text placeholder. For a production release, you would need:
# - A proper .ico file with multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
# - Created using an icon editor or converted from PNG/SVG
# - This file serves as a placeholder for the build system

# For now, we'll rely on NSIS to use its default icon
# To add a proper icon:
# 1. Create or obtain a ddogreen.ico file
# 2. Place it in this directory 
# 3. Update the CPACK_NSIS_MUI_ICON setting in CMakeLists.txt
