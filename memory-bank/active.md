  - TLP and tlp-rdw for Linux power management  
  - cpufrequtils for CPU frequency control
  - ACPI and thermal management tools
  - Complete kernel module loading (ondemand, performance, powersave, conservative, userspace)

**Realistic Hardware Simulation**:
- **CPU Frequency Structure**: Created complete /sys/devices/system/cpu/*/cpufreq/ hierarchy
- **Governor Files**: Writable scaling_governor files with realistic values (powersave, performance, ondemand, etc.)

### Previous Achievement (Aug 20, 2025): Power Management Testing Infrastructure ✅
**COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented streamlined power management testing integrated directly into CI/CD workflow
- **Integrated Testing**: Power management tests now run as part of existing `test-linux` job
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Eliminated redundant separate job - tests run before packaging
- **Local Testing Script**: Maintained `scripts/test_power_management.sh` for local development
- **Test Coverage**: Complete power management workflow validation:
  - Low load detection (power save mode)
  - High load detection via CPU stress (high performance mode)  
  - Recovery monitoring (return to power save mode)
  - Error handling validation
  - Configuration loading tests

**Technical Implementation**:
- **CI/CD Integration**: Power management tests integrated into existing `test-linux` job
- **Dependencies**: Added stress tool installation to existing dependency step
- **Monitoring**: Real-time load average monitoring during test phases
- **Efficient Workflow**: Tests run immediately after unit tests, before packaging
- **4-Phase Test Protocol**:
  1. Basic functionality (help, version, dry-run)
  2. Power management simulation (stress → high perf → recovery → power save)
  3. Real-time load monitoring during all phases
  4. Process cleanup and validation
- **Streamlined Dependencies**: Package jobs depend only on build and test jobs

**Workflow Optimization Benefits**:
- **Reduced CI Time**: No separate job overhead - tests run in existing infrastructure
- **Faster Feedback**: Power management issues detected immediately after unit tests
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reuses existing build artifacts and environment
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Single test job to maintain instead of multiple workflows
- **Clear Test Flow**: Static Analysis → Build → Unit Tests → Power Management Tests → Packaging
- **Comprehensive Validation**: 60-second stress + 60-second recovery with mode change assertions
- **Intelligent Thresholds**: Correctly validates hysteresis behavior (70% entry, 30% exit thresholds)

### Previous Achievement (Aug 20, 2025): Windows MSI Packaging Fix Completed ✅
**COMPLETED**: Successfully identified and fixed Windows MSI packaging issues in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- **Root Cause Identified**: File path structure changes broke WiX template compatibility
- **Solution Applied**: Restored working WiX template from tag v0.3.0 
- **Key Fix**: File paths must include `ddogreen-windows` subdirectory:
  - `@CPACK_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY@/ddogreen-windows/bin/ddogreen.exe`
  - `@CPACK_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY@/ddogreen-windows/share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default`
- **Configuration Verified**: CMakeLists.txt already has correct `CPACK_WIX_VERSION "4"` for WiX v5 compatibility
- **Custom Actions Restored**: All NSSM service installation custom actions working as designed

**Technical Details**:
- **Problem**: Recent simplification removed intermediate `ddogreen-windows` directory from file paths
- **Impact**: WiX couldn't locate source files during MSI generation, causing "Problem running WiX" errors
- **Fix**: Restored exact file paths from working v0.3.0 tag where MSI packaging was functional
- **Validation**: Template syntax validated against WiX v4 schema (compatible with WiX v5.0.2 toolset)
