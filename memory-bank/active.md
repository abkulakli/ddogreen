   - `canonicalizePath()`: Safe path canonicalization
   - `isPathWithinDirectory()`: Directory boundary validation
2. **RateLimiter Class**: Token bucket algorithm for DoS protection
   - Configurable rate limiting (5 requests per 1000ms default)
   - Thread-safe implementation with mutex protection
   - Automatic cleanup of old entries
3. **Platform Integration**: Security hardening across all platforms
   - Linux/Windows/macOS power managers with rate limiting
   - Secure command line argument parsing
   - Enhanced privilege validation

**TDD Implementation Status**:
- ✅ **RED Phase**: 9 security tests written, identified vulnerabilities
- ✅ **GREEN Phase**: All security fixes implemented, 100% test success
- ✅ **REFACTOR Phase**: Clean, maintainable security architecture

**Rate Limiting Evidence**: Test demonstrates proper functionality
- First 5 requests attempt execution (may fail due to TLP unavailability)
- Requests 6-15 immediately blocked by rate limiter
- No failed tests or useless functionality as requested

**Previous (Aug 14, 2025): Naming Standards Implementation - COMPLETED**
**COMPLETED**: Established formal naming standards and consolidated all documentation into memory bank
- **Standards Integration**: Moved comprehensive naming standards into `memory-bank/standards.md`
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Removed separate `NAMING_STANDARDS.md` file per memory bank rules
- **File Management Rules**: Added strict rules against creating additional documentation files
- **Brand Names**: `DDOSoft`/`DDOGreen` for display/marketing purposes  
- **Technical Names**: `ddosoft`/`ddogreen` for folders, executables, and URLs
- **Codebase Fixes**: Updated all inconsistent naming across the project
  - Fixed MSI packaging to use lowercase `ddosoft` folder names
  - Updated Windows platform utils hardcoded paths to use `ddosoft`
  - Fixed README.md documentation to reflect correct paths
- **Documentation Rule**: User info → README.md, Developer info → memory bank
- **Validation**: Platform and configuration tests passing (70/71 tests, 1 unrelated threading test failing)

**Technical Implementation**:
```
Brand Names (Display):     DDOSoft, DDOGreen
Technical Names (Files):   ddosoft, ddogreen  
Folder Structure:          C:\Program Files\ddosoft\ddogreen\
Configuration:             %ProgramData%\ddosoft\ddogreen\ddogreen.conf
```

**Result**: Consistent naming throughout project following industry best practices for cross-platform compatibility

### Latest Update (Aug 14, 2025): Battery/AC Power Detection - COMPLETED
**COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented cross-platform battery/AC power source detection
- **Interface Enhancement**: Added `PowerSource` enumeration and `getPowerSource()` method to `IPlatformUtils`
- **Linux Implementation**: Uses `/sys/class/power_supply/` subsystem to detect AC adapters and batteries
- **Windows Implementation**: Uses `GetSystemPowerStatus()` Windows API for power source detection
- **macOS Implementation**: Uses IOKit `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo()` for comprehensive power source detection
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit test (`test_power_source_detection`) with 71/71 tests passing
- **Validation**: Real-world testing confirms accurate detection of AC_POWER when plugged in

**Technical Implementation Details**:
```cpp
enum class PowerSource { BATTERY, AC_POWER, UNKNOWN };
virtual PowerSource getPowerSource() const = 0;

// Linux: Iterates /sys/class/power_supply/ checking type and online status
// Windows: Uses GetSystemPowerStatus() ACLineStatus field  
// macOS: Uses IOKit IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo() with power source state checking
```

**Result**: Cross-platform power source detection ready for implementing battery-aware power management

### Project Status: PRODUCTION-READY - ENHANCED
