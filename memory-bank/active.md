# DDOGreen - Current Focus & Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: Memory Bank Restructuring - Completed August 14, 2025
**Current State**: Production-ready application with updated GitHub Copilot instructions and streamlined 3-file memory bank structure

### Latest Update (Aug 14, 2025): Memory Bank Restructuring - COMPLETED
**COMPLETED**: Successfully restructured memory bank to align with new GitHub Copilot instructions
- **New Structure**: Consolidated from 10 detailed files to 3 core files (context.md, standards.md, active.md)
- **Context Preserved**: All critical project information maintained in streamlined format
- **Core Focus**: Project essentials, working methodology, and current priorities accessible in core files
- **MCP Integration**: Added Model Context Protocol usage requirements to working standards
- **Session Continuity**: All operational rules and standards now accessible in core 3-file structure

**Result**: Streamlined memory bank structure that ensures effective session continuity and context preservation

### Project Status: PRODUCTION-READY - MAINTAINED
The core project remains in production-ready state:
- **Build Status**: All builds successful (debug/release/test/coverage)
- **Test Status**: 70/70 tests passing with 100% success rate
- **Code Quality**: Zero compiler warnings maintained across entire codebase
- **Architecture**: Clean platform abstraction with zero conditional compilation in application layer
- **Standards**: Energy-efficient coding practices and C++20 modern features implemented

### Previously Completed (Aug 14, 2025): Energy-Efficient Coding Standards - IMPLEMENTED
**COMPLETED**: Enhanced coding standards to emphasize energy efficiency and sustainable programming practices
- **Energy-First Philosophy**: Established algorithmic efficiency over micro-optimization as core principle
- **Sustainable Code Patterns**: Documented memory-efficient, CPU-friendly, and I/O-optimized patterns
- **Compile-Time Optimization**: Enhanced use of `constexpr` to move computation from runtime to compile-time
- **Cache-Friendly Design**: Added guidelines for structure-of-arrays and cache-conscious data layout
- **Resource-Conscious I/O**: Established patterns for batched operations and appropriate buffer sizing
- **Sleep Over Polling**: Emphasized blocking operations and proper sleep patterns over busy waiting
- **Energy Documentation**: Added requirement to document energy trade-offs in code comments
- **Memory Pool Patterns**: Guidelines for container reuse and pre-allocation strategies

### Previously Completed (Aug 14, 2025): Zero Warning Policy Implementation - COMPLETED
**COMPLETED**: Established and implemented zero warning policy through code improvements, not warning suppression
- **Comprehensive Warning System**: Enabled ALL advanced compiler warnings (-Wall, -Wextra, -Wpedantic, -Wconversion, -Wshadow, etc.)
- **Code Quality Fixes**: Fixed all project warnings through proper code improvements (never disabled warnings)
- **Completely Warning-Free Build**: Achieved zero warnings in entire build including proper external library handling
- **External Library Management**: Added proper warning suppression for GoogleTest while maintaining all warnings for project code
- **Critical Error Prevention**: Enabled -Werror=return-type and -Werror=uninitialized for bug prevention

### Previously Completed (Aug 14, 2025): C++20 Standard Upgrade - COMPLETED
**COMPLETED**: Upgraded project from C++17 to C++20 standard for modern C++ features
- **Standard Upgrade**: Updated CMakeLists.txt to set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`
- **Build Verification**: Both debug and release builds successful with C++20
- **Feature Utilization**: Using modern C++20 features like concepts, ranges, and improved constexpr

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Monitor New Structure**: Ensure the 3-file memory bank structure supports effective session continuity
2. **Validate Context Access**: Verify all critical project information remains accessible
3. **Test Workflow**: Validate that new GitHub Copilot instructions workflow operates effectively
4. **Maintain Standards**: Continue following energy efficiency and architectural principles

## Active Development Areas
- **Memory Bank Validation**: Ensuring the new 3-file structure provides complete project context
- **MCP Integration**: Proper Model Context Protocol usage for all external library interactions
- **Standards Maintenance**: Continuing energy efficiency and zero warning policies as core principles
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintaining 100% test success rate and zero compiler warnings

## Current Constraints
- **New Structure Validation**: Ensure the streamlined memory bank maintains all essential context
- **Information Accessibility**: All critical project knowledge must remain readily available
- **Standards Compliance**: Continue following energy efficiency and architectural principles
- **Build Integrity**: Maintain current build system and test success rates

## Focus Philosophy
- **Energy Efficiency First**: All code changes prioritize computational and energy optimization
- **Architecture Purity**: Maintain clean platform abstraction without conditional compilation
- **Quality Over Speed**: Prefer proper code fixes over quick workarounds
- **Documentation Currency**: Keep memory bank synchronized with actual project state
