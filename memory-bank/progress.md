## Previous Achievement: Package Structure Standardization Completed

### Cross-Platform Package Structure Unification
- **Standardization Completed**: All platforms now use `share/ddogreen/` for configuration files
- **CMake Simplification**: Removed platform-specific conditional installation logic
- **FHS Compliance**: Follows Filesystem Hierarchy Standard across all platforms
- **Installer Updates**: Windows and Linux installers updated with standardized paths
- **Package Verification**: Confirmed working with TGZ package generation test

### Technical Implementation Success
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Simplified configuration installation to single `DESTINATION share/ddogreen`
- **Windows Installer**: Updated to prioritize `share\ddogreen\` with backward compatibility
- **Linux Installer**: Updated to prioritize `share/ddogreen/` with legacy fallbacks
- **Build Verification**: Release build and package generation tested successfully

### Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **True Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical package structure across Linux and Windows
- **Standards Compliance**: Proper FHS conventions followed
- **Maintenance Simplification**: No platform-specific conditional logic needed
- **User Experience**: Consistent file locations regardless of platform

## Previous Achievement: Memory Bank Documentation Verification - COMPLETED

### Documentation Integrity Issues Discovered
- **Package Structure Claims**: Memory bank falsely documented standardization to `data/` folder that was never implemented
- **Service Installation Claims**: Partially correct - executable service options were removed but CMakeLists.txt still references them
- **Build System Claims**: Correctly documented and verified working
- **Architecture Claims**: Correctly documented and verified working

### Current Actual State (August 1, 2025)
- **All 24 Unit Tests**: ✅ PASSING - verified working
- **Cross-Platform Build**: ✅ CONFIRMED - CMake presets working properly
- **Platform Abstraction**: ✅ CONFIRMED - zero platform-specific code in main application
- **Configuration System**: ✅ CONFIRMED - read-only validation system working
- **Service Installation**: ✅ PARTIALLY CORRECT - executable options removed, but CMakeLists.txt inconsistent

### Package Structure Reality Check
**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION** (contradicts memory bank claims):
```cmake
# Linux packages: STILL use share/ddogreen (not data/)
if(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux")
    install(FILES "config/ddogreen.conf.default"
            DESTINATION share/ddogreen)  # ← NOT data/ as claimed
            
# Windows packages: use data/ 
else()
    install(FILES "config/ddogreen.conf.default"
            DESTINATION data)
endif()
```

**Installer Script Reality**: Linux TGZ installer checks BOTH locations for backward compatibility:
```bash
if [[ -f "data/ddogreen.conf.default" ]]; then
    CONFIG_SOURCE="data/ddogreen.conf.default"
elif [[ -f "share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default" ]]; then  # Fallback
    CONFIG_SOURCE="share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default"
```

## Latest Achievement: Comprehensive Codebase Review and Verification

### Monitoring Frequency Support Implementation
- **System Monitor Interface Enhancement**: Added `setMonitoringFrequency()` method to `ISystemMonitor` interface
- **Windows Implementation Refinement**: Enhanced Windows system monitor to use configurable monitoring frequency
- **Dynamic Load Calculation**: Load average calculations now properly scale with monitoring frequency settings
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: All platform implementations support monitoring frequency configuration
- **Integration Complete**: ActivityMonitor propagates frequency changes to system monitor automatically

### Technical Implementation Benefits
- **Accurate Load Averaging**: 1-minute load averages scale correctly regardless of monitoring frequency (10s, 30s, 60s)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Sample windows adapt to frequency - shorter frequencies maintain smaller buffers
- **Configuration Driven**: User can configure monitoring frequency and system responds appropriately
- **Platform Uniformity**: Linux uses kernel load average, Windows calculates dynamically, macOS ready for implementation
- **Better Responsiveness**: Configurable frequency allows tuning between responsiveness and stability

### Architecture Quality Improvements
- **Interface Completeness**: ISystemMonitor interface now fully supports configuration requirements
- **Implementation Consistency**: All platforms implement the interface uniformly (including appropriate no-ops)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented implementations with proper boundary checking
- **Test Coverage**: All 24 unit tests continue to pass, ensuring regression-free enhancement

  - **Windows**: Uses `GetFullPathName()` for Windows-compatible path resolution
  - **macOS**: Uses `realpath()` implementation (same as Linux)
- **Conditional Compilation Removal**: Completely eliminated all `#ifdef _WIN32` blocks from main.cpp
- **Include Cleanup**: Removed Windows.h dependency from main application layer
