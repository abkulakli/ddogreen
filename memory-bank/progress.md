## Major Milestones Achieved

### Milestone 1: Ultra-Simplification ✅ (Latest)
- Removed ALL configuration file support and related code
- Switched from CPU monitoring to 1-minute load average monitoring
- Hardcoded all settings for maximum reliability and minimal resource usage
- Updated all terminology to correctly reflect TLP's actual modes
- Achieved warning-free compilation

### Milestone 2: Load Average Implementation ✅
- Implemented direct `/proc/loadavg` reading
- Set check interval to 60 seconds for minimal system impact
- Eliminated CPU sampling, averaging, and circular buffer complexity
- Achieved single-purpose, focused implementation

### Milestone 3: Configuration Elimination ✅
- Deleted `config.cpp`, `config.h`, and entire `config/` directory
- Removed all configuration parsing and validation logic
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to remove config file installation
- Simplified main.cpp to only support essential command-line options

### Milestone 4: Terminology Corrections ✅
- Fixed all logging to use "auto mode" instead of "performance mode"
- Corrected documentation to reflect TLP's actual mode names
- Updated comments and help output for accuracy
- Ensured consistency across all user-facing text

## What Works - Production Ready ✅

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Load Average Monitoring**: Stable 1-minute load average reading every 60 seconds
- ✅ **TLP Integration**: Reliable switching between `tlp start` and `tlp bat`
- ✅ **Activity Detection**: Load threshold of 0.15 provides good sensitivity
- ✅ **Idle Detection**: 300-second timeout provides reasonable power savings
- ✅ **Mode Switching**: Only switches when activity state actually changes

### System Integration
- ✅ **Systemd Service**: Service starts cleanly and runs reliably
- ✅ **Daemon Operation**: Proper background operation with signal handling
- ✅ **Logging**: Clear, timestamped logs with TLP output capture
- ✅ **Build System**: Clean compilation with zero warnings
- ✅ **Installation**: Simple deployment with no configuration required

## Implementation Details

### Current Settings (Hardcoded)
```cpp
const double loadThreshold = 0.15; // 15% load average (0.15 load)
const int checkInterval = 60;      // 1 minute between checks
const string logFile = "/var/log/ddogreen.log";
```

### Monitoring Logic (Simplified)
1. Read 1-minute load average from `/proc/loadavg` every 60 seconds
2. If load > 0.15, switch to auto mode (if not already active)
3. If load ≤ 0.15, switch to battery mode (if not already idle)
4. Only switch TLP modes when activity state actually changes
5. No idle timeout - decision made immediately based on current load

### Resource Usage
- **CPU Usage**: Negligible (checks load once per minute)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (no configuration buffers or complex data structures)
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal (only log file writes and occasional `/proc/loadavg` reads)
- **Network**: None
- Basic logging system

### Milestone 2: X11 Implementation ✅ (Initial Approach)
- X11-based user activity detection
- XScreenSaver integration
- GUI environment dependency

### Milestone 3: Simplified CPU Implementation ✅ (Major Refactor)
- **Removed X11 Dependencies**: Eliminated GUI requirements
- **CPU-Based Monitoring**: Universal Linux compatibility
- **Improved Architecture**: Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Milestone 4: Enhanced Logging ✅ (Quality Improvement)
- **Millisecond Timestamps**: Improved debugging capability

- **Log Management**: Proper rotation and cleanup

### Milestone 5: Production Ready ✅ (Final Polish)
- **Build System Cleanup**: CMake-only approach
- **Installation Automation**: Complete install/uninstall scripts
- **Documentation Complete**: README, memory bank, troubleshooting
- **Testing Validated**: Manual testing on multiple systems
