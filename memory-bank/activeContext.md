# Active Context - ddotlp

## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: Production-ready, systemd PID file issue resolved
**Last Updated**: July 1, 2025
**Current Priority**: All major issues resolved, project complete

## Recent Major Changes

### 1. Simplified Implementation (Latest)
- **Removed X11 Dependencies**: Eliminated libx11-dev and libxss-dev requirements
- **CPU-Based Monitoring**: Switched from X11 events to `/proc/stat` CPU usage monitoring
- **Universal Compatibility**: Now works on headless servers, Wayland systems, and any Linux environment
- **Cleaner Build**: No external library dependencies, CMake-only build system

### 2. Enhanced Logging System
- **Millisecond Timestamps**: Improved logging precision from seconds to milliseconds
- **TLP Output Capture**: Now captures and logs all TLP command output with proper timestamps
- **Clean Output Processing**: Added `cleanTLPOutput()` function for better log readability
- **Log Rotation**: Added logrotate configuration for proper log management

### 4. ddosoft Branding Integration (Latest) ✅
- **Copyright Headers**: Added ddosoft copyright to main.cpp with www.ddosoft.com URL
- **Version Information**: Updated version output to include ddosoft attribution
- **CMake Metadata**: Added ddosoft homepage URL to CMakeLists.txt project definition
- **README Branding**: Added "Developed by ddosoft (www.ddosoft.com)" prominently in README
- **Service Documentation**: Added ddosoft documentation URL to systemd service file
- **Consistent Attribution**: Ensured branding appears in all user-facing contexts
### 3. Build System Cleanup ✅
- **CMake Primary**: Removed redundant Makefile, using CMake as primary build system
- **Build Script**: Created build.sh for easy compilation
- **Dependency Management**: Simplified dependency requirements

### 5. Systemd PID File Issue Resolution (Latest) ✅
- **Problem**: Service worked but systemd complained "Can't open PID file '/run/ddotlp.pid' (yet?) after start"
- **Root Cause**: Timing issue between systemd expecting PID file availability and daemon double-fork process
- **Solution**: Removed PIDFile directive from systemd service configuration
- **Result**: Service now starts cleanly without any warnings or errors
- **Impact**: Proper systemd integration with clean startup and no race conditions

## Current Implementation Details

### Activity Monitoring Approach
- **CPU Threshold**: Default 15% CPU usage to determine "active" state
- **Sampling Rate**: CPU checks every 5 seconds to balance accuracy and performance
- **Idle Detection**: System considered idle after 5 minutes (300 seconds) below threshold
- **State Transitions**: Only switches TLP modes when state actually changes

### Logging Format
```
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.123] [INFO] System became active (CPU usage detected)
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.124] [INFO] Switching to performance mode (tlp start)
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.456] [INFO] TLP output: TLP started in AC mode (auto).
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.457] [INFO] Successfully switched to performance mode
```

### Configuration Options
- `IDLE_TIMEOUT`: Time before switching to battery mode (default: 300 seconds)
- `CPU_THRESHOLD`: CPU usage percentage for activity detection (default: 15.0%)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `AUTO_SWITCH_ENABLED`: Enable/disable automatic switching

## Immediate Next Steps

### Project Complete ✅
All major objectives have been achieved:
- ✅ **Core Implementation**: CPU-based activity monitoring and TLP management
- ✅ **System Integration**: Proper systemd service with security hardening
- ✅ **Build System**: Modern CMake with installation scripts
- ✅ **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging with millisecond precision
- ✅ **ddosoft Branding**: Complete integration across all user-facing components
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and memory bank documentation

### Optional Future Enhancements
- Configuration file parsing with validation
- Dynamic threshold adjustment based on usage patterns
- Advanced CPU metrics (load average, process-specific monitoring)
- Desktop notifications for mode changes
- Performance metrics export
- Web-based monitoring interface

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Resolved Issues ✅
- ✅ **X11 Dependency**: Eliminated by switching to CPU monitoring
- ✅ **Build Complexity**: Simplified to CMake-only approach
- ✅ **Logging Precision**: Added millisecond timestamps
- ✅ **TLP Output**: Now captured and properly formatted
- ✅ **ddosoft Branding**: Complete integration across all components
- ✅ **Systemd PID File**: Resolved timing issue with PID file availability

### Optional Future Considerations
- **Configuration File Parsing**: Currently using hardcoded config values
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Could adapt thresholds based on usage patterns
- **Multiple CPU Metrics**: Could consider load average or specific process monitoring
- **User Notifications**: Optional desktop notifications for mode changes

## Development Patterns Established

### Code Organization
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for ActivityMonitor, TLPManager, Logger, Daemon
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined callback system for activity events
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and logging
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and thread management

### Build & Deployment
- **CMake Standard**: Using modern CMake practices
- **Installation Scripts**: Automated build, install, and uninstall processes
- **Systemd Integration**: Proper service definition with security hardening
- **Log Management**: Integrated logrotate configuration

### Quality Practices
- **Detailed Logging**: Every significant action is logged with context
- **Signal Handling**: Proper daemon lifecycle management
- **Security**: Runs with minimal required privileges
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation

## Project Health - Production Ready ✅
