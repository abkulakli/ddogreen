# Active Context - DDOGreen

## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION-READY
**Last Updated**: July 22, 2025
**Current State**: Maintenance mode - all features implemented and tested

## Current Context: Product Name Branding Update

### Latest Update: Consistent Product Name Branding Applied
- **Change**: Updated product name display from "ddogreen" to "DDOGreen" in user-facing messages
- **Scope**: Version output, service descriptions, log messages, and build script messages
- **Technical Names**: All filenames, directories, and technical references remain "ddogreen" (lowercase)
- **Result**: Clear distinction between product branding (DDOGreen) and technical implementation (ddogreen)
- **Files Updated**:
  - `src/main.cpp`: Version output, startup messages, service messages
  - `packaging/linux/*/`: Service descriptions in installer scripts
  - `build.ps1`: Build script branding message
- **Verification**: `./build/ddogreen --version` now shows "DDOGreen version 0.2.4"

### Latest Fix: Build Script CI Dependencies Added
- **Issue**: `test-build-scripts` job failing in GitHub Actions due to missing MinGW cross-compiler
- **Root Cause**: Build script now builds both Linux and Windows by default, but CI runner lacks MinGW toolchain
- **Solution Applied**: Added MinGW installation step to `test-build-scripts` job in GitHub Actions workflow
- **Dependencies Added**: `gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 g++-mingw-w64-x86-64` for Windows cross-compilation
- **Result**: Build script testing now works correctly in CI environment with both platform builds
- **Status**: Ready for next CI run validation

### Previous Implementation: Development vs Release Version Strategy
- **Strategy**: Clear distinction between development and release builds
- **Implementation**:
  - **Development/Untagged Builds**: Default to version "0.0.0" to indicate development state
  - **Tagged/Release Builds**: Use actual release version (e.g., "0.2.4") extracted from git tags
  - **CMakeLists.txt**: Default PROJECT_VERSION_OVERRIDE set to "0.0.0" for development
  - **GitHub Actions**: Only tagged builds (refs/tags/*) use extracted version, untagged builds get 0.0.0
- **Benefits**:
  - **Clear Development Identification**: Local builds and non-release CI runs show 0.0.0
  - **Proper Release Versioning**: Only official releases show actual version numbers
  - **Flexibility**: PROJECT_VERSION_OVERRIDE parameter still allows custom versioning
- **Testing Verified**: 
  - Local builds without override: `ddogreen version 0.0.0`
  - Builds with override: `ddogreen version 0.2.4`
  - Build script works correctly with new strategy

### Previous Fix: GitHub Actions Version Fix Applied  
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions builds were showing version 0.0.0 instead of the expected 0.2.4
- **Root Cause**: CMakeLists.txt defaulted to "0.0.0" for local development, but GitHub Actions wasn't using version override for all jobs
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt default version from "0.0.0" to "0.2.4" (current release version)
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow to apply version override consistently across all jobs (test, test-build-scripts, build-packages)
  - Maintained backward compatibility - `PROJECT_VERSION_OVERRIDE` parameter still works for custom versions
- **Verification**: Local builds and GitHub Actions will now correctly show version 0.2.4
- **Build Commands**: Both `./build.sh` and direct CMake commands now display correct version

### Previous Achievement: Platform Abstraction Enhancement Complete
- **Refactoring**: Successfully moved all platform-specific path resolution code from main.cpp to platform utilities
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `resolveAbsolutePath()` method to IPlatformUtils interface
  - Linux implementation uses `realpath()` for canonical path resolution
  - Windows implementation uses `GetFullPathName()` for path resolution  
  - macOS implementation uses `realpath()` (same as Linux)
  - Completely removed `#ifdef _WIN32` conditional compilation from main.cpp
  - Removed Windows.h include dependency from main.cpp
- **Benefits**: 
  - **Cleaner main.cpp**: Zero platform-specific code or includes remaining
  - **Better abstraction**: Path resolution logic properly encapsulated in platform layer
  - **Maintainability**: All platform-specific code isolated and testable
  - **Consistency**: Unified interface across all platforms
- **Build Verification**: Both Linux (164K) and Windows (2.6M) builds working perfectly

### Previous Achievement: Dual-Platform Build System Complete
- **Enhancement**: Removed `--windows` flag - build.sh now builds both Linux and Windows by default
- **Implementation**: 
  - Single command (`./build.sh`) produces both Linux and Windows binaries simultaneously
  - Automatic cross-compilation setup with MinGW toolchain detection
  - Simultaneous packaging for both platforms with `./build.sh --package`
  - Comprehensive error handling and build verification for both platforms
- **Results**: 
  - **Linux**: Native binary (164K) + DEB/RPM/TGZ packages (64-76K each)
  - **Windows**: Cross-compiled .exe (2.6M) + NSIS installer + ZIP packages
  - **Build Speed**: Parallel compilation with efficient dependency checking
- **Usage Simplified**:
  - `./build.sh` - Build both Linux and Windows binaries
  - `./build.sh --package` - Build + create all packages for both platforms
  - `./build.sh --debug` - Debug builds for both platforms
  - `./build.sh --clean` - Clean both build directories

### Memory Bank Organization Reference
**IMPORTANT**: Follow content placement guidelines in `systemPatterns.md` â†’ "Memory Bank Organization Guidelines"
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and immediate context only
- **progress.md**: Completed achievements and milestones only  
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture, patterns, and technical specifications
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and development environment
- **projectbrief.md**: Project scope and core requirements
- **productContext.md**: Business purpose and user value

## Current Priorities

### Immediate Focus: Version Fix Complete - Monitoring  
- **Status**: Version display issue resolved - GitHub Actions will now show 0.2.4 correctly
- **Architecture**: Clean platform abstraction with zero conditional compilation in main application
- **Build System**: Unified dual-platform build system with correct versioning
- **Documentation**: Memory bank properly organized and maintained
- **Testing**: Version fix verified locally, ready for GitHub Actions validation

### Next Steps (If Needed)
- **Deployment**: Ready for production installation on target systems
- **Monitoring**: Can add system monitoring if user requests
- **Extensions**: Platform expansion ready (all platform abstractions in place)
- **Maintenance**: Standard maintenance and updates as needed

## Technical Context

### Latest Technical Decisions
- **Platform Abstraction Strategy**: Moved all OS-specific code to platform layer
- **Path Resolution Strategy**: Platform-specific implementations (realpath vs GetFullPathName)
- **Build Strategy**: Unified dual-platform compilation from single command
- **Memory Bank Strategy**: Proper content organization per file purposes

### Architecture Insights
- **Clean Architecture**: Platform abstraction successfully implemented with zero conditional compilation
- **Cross-Platform Pattern**: Factory pattern with interface-based platform selection
- **Build Pattern**: MinGW cross-compilation with static linking for Windows portability
- **Code Organization**: Complete separation of platform-specific code from application logic
