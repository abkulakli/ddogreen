## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: Package Structure Standardization - COMPLETED
**Last Updated**: August 1, 2025
**Current State**: Production-ready cross-platform application with consistent package structure across all platforms

## Recent Implementation: Package Structure Standardization - COMPLETED

### Completed Task: Unified Package Structure Using share/ddogreen Across All Platforms
- **Issue Resolved**: Inconsistent package structure between Linux and Windows packages
- **Problem Solved**: Mixed implementation where Linux used `share/ddogreen` and Windows used `data/`
- **Goal Achieved**: True standardization with `share/ddogreen` used consistently across all platforms

### Implementation Summary
- **Standardized Path**: All packages now use `share/ddogreen/` for configuration files
- **CMakeLists Simplification**: Removed platform-specific conditional logic for configuration installation
- **Installer Updates**: Updated Windows and Linux installers to prioritize standardized location
- **Backward Compatibility**: Installers maintain fallback to legacy locations for smooth transitions
- **FHS Compliance**: Following Filesystem Hierarchy Standard conventions across platforms

### Package Structure (Now Truly Standardized)
```
All Packages (Linux TGZ/DEB/RPM + Windows ZIP/NSIS):
├── bin/
│   └── ddogreen(.exe)           # Executable binary
├── share/
│   └── ddogreen/
│       └── ddogreen.conf.default # Configuration file (consistent location)
└── installer.{sh|bat}           # Platform-specific installer script
```

### Technical Implementation Details
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Simplified to use `DESTINATION share/ddogreen` for all platforms
- **Windows installer.bat**: Uses standardized `share\ddogreen\` location with clear error handling
- **Linux installer.sh**: Uses standardized `share/ddogreen/` location with clear error handling
- **Fallback Logic Removed**: No legacy location support needed with consistent packaging
- **Package Verification**: Confirmed TGZ package contains `share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default`
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if expected standardized structure is missing

### Architecture Benefits
- **True Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical package structure across all platforms
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows FHS conventions for application data files
- **Simplified Maintenance**: No platform-specific configuration installation logic
- **Better User Experience**: Consistent file locations regardless of platform
- **Easier Documentation**: Single package structure to document and support
- **Simplified Installers**: No fallback logic needed - clear error handling for missing files
- **Reliable Installation**: Packages either have correct structure or fail fast with clear errors

## Previous Critical Finding: Memory Bank Documentation Inconsistencies - RESOLVED

### Previous Critical Finding: Memory Bank Documentation Inconsistencies - RESOLVED

**Original Issue**: Memory bank incorrectly documented that package structure standardization was completed, when actually mixed implementation existed.

**Resolution**: Implemented true standardization by adopting `share/ddogreen` consistently across all platforms, making the memory bank claims accurate.

**Evidence of Resolution**:
```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt (UPDATED CODE)
install(FILES "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/config/ddogreen.conf.default"
        DESTINATION share/ddogreen)  # ← Now consistent for all platforms!
```

**Package Verification**:
```bash
$ tar -tzf ddogreen-linux.tar.gz
ddogreen-linux/share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default  # ✅ Standardized structure
```

**Impact**: Memory bank documentation now accurately reflects actual implementation.

### Service Installation Documentation Error - REQUIRES CORRECTION
**Issue Discovered**: Memory bank incorrectly documented that service installation was completely removed from the executable.

**Actual Current State**:
- **Windows NSIS Installer**: Still includes service installation commands in CMakeLists.txt (lines 138-147)
- **Linux Package Scripts**: Use package installer scripts (correctly documented)
- **Executable Service Commands**: Unknown if `--install-service` options were actually removed

**Evidence of Inconsistency**:
```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt lines 138-147 (ACTUAL CODE)
set(CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_INSTALL_COMMANDS "
    ; Install Windows service
    ExecWait '$INSTDIR\\\\bin\\\\ddogreen.exe --install-service' $0
    DetailPrint 'Service installation exit code: $0'
    ")
```

## Previous Implementation: Windows Real CPU Queue Length Implementation - COMPLETED

### Completed Task: Removed Mock Implementation and Added Real Processor Queue Length
- **Issue Resolved**: Windows system monitor used mock/fake data instead of real processor queue monitoring

- **Goal Achieved**: True Windows load average equivalent using processor queue length performance counters

### Implementation Summary
- **Mock Code Removal**: Completely removed all mock/fake implementations from Windows system monitor
- **Real Queue Length**: Implemented `getCurrentQueueLength()` using Windows Performance Counter `\System\Processor Queue Length`
