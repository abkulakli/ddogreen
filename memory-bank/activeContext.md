# Active Context - ddotlp

## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: Core implementation complete, enhanced logging system implemented
**Last Updated**: June 30, 2025
**Current Priority**: Project cleanup and documentation finalization

## Recent Major Changes

### 1. Simplified Implementation (Latest)
- **Removed X11 Dependencies**: Eliminated libx11-dev and libxss-dev requirements
- **CPU-Based Monitoring**: Switched from X11 events to `/proc/stat` CPU usage monitoring
- **Universal Compatibility**: Now works on headless servers, Wayland systems, and any Linux environment
- **Cleaner Build**: No external library dependencies, CMake-only build system

### 2. Enhanced Logging System
- **Millisecond Timestamps**: Improved logging precision from seconds to milliseconds
- **TLP Output Capture**: Now captures and logs all TLP command output with proper timestamps
- **Clean Output Processing**: Added `cleanTLPOutput()` function for better log readability
- **Log Rotation**: Added logrotate configuration for proper log management

### 3. Build System Cleanup
- **CMake Primary**: Removed redundant Makefile, using CMake as primary build system
- **Installation Scripts**: Updated install.sh to use CMake exclusively
- **Build Script**: Created build.sh for easy compilation
- **Dependency Management**: Simplified dependency requirements

## Current Implementation Details

### Activity Monitoring Approach
- **CPU Threshold**: Default 15% CPU usage to determine "active" state
- **Sampling Rate**: CPU checks every 5 seconds to balance accuracy and performance
- **Idle Detection**: System considered idle after 5 minutes (300 seconds) below threshold
- **State Transitions**: Only switches TLP modes when state actually changes

### Logging Format
```
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.123] [INFO] System became active (CPU usage detected)
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.124] [INFO] Switching to performance mode (tlp start)
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.456] [INFO] TLP output: TLP started in AC mode (auto).
[2025-06-30 21:14:15.457] [INFO] Successfully switched to performance mode
```

### Configuration Options
- `IDLE_TIMEOUT`: Time before switching to battery mode (default: 300 seconds)
- `CPU_THRESHOLD`: CPU usage percentage for activity detection (default: 15.0%)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `AUTO_SWITCH_ENABLED`: Enable/disable automatic switching

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Memory Bank Creation ✅
- Document project architecture and decisions
- Capture current implementation state
- Establish patterns for future development

### 2. Testing and Validation
- Test installation on clean systems
- Verify TLP integration works correctly
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate log rotation functionality

### 3. Documentation Finalization
- Update README with final implementation details
- Add troubleshooting section
- Document configuration options thoroughly
- Create quick start guide

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ **X11 Dependency**: Eliminated by switching to CPU monitoring
- ✅ **Build Complexity**: Simplified to CMake-only approach
- ✅ **Logging Precision**: Added millisecond timestamps
- ✅ **TLP Output**: Now captured and properly formatted

### Open Considerations
- **Configuration File Parsing**: Currently using hardcoded config values
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Could adapt thresholds based on usage patterns
- **Multiple CPU Metrics**: Could consider load average or specific process monitoring
- **User Notifications**: Optional desktop notifications for mode changes

## Development Patterns Established

### Code Organization
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for ActivityMonitor, TLPManager, Logger, Daemon
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined callback system for activity events
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and logging
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and thread management

### Build & Deployment
- **CMake Standard**: Using modern CMake practices
- **Installation Scripts**: Automated build, install, and uninstall processes
- **Systemd Integration**: Proper service definition with security hardening
- **Log Management**: Integrated logrotate configuration

### Quality Practices
- **Detailed Logging**: Every significant action is logged with context
- **Signal Handling**: Proper daemon lifecycle management
- **Security**: Runs with minimal required privileges
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation

## Project Health
- **Build Status**: ✅ Clean compilation on latest systems
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Minimal and commonly available
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive and up-to-date
- **Testing**: ⚠️ Manual testing completed, automated testing needed
- **Deployment**: ✅ Installation scripts working correctly
