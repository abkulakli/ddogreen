# Active Context - ddops

## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: UPDATED - Platform Abstraction Layer Implemented
**Last Updated**: July 16, 2025
**Current Priority**: Cross-platform support with compile-time optimization

## Latest Update: Platform Abstraction Layer ✅

### Cross-Platform Architecture Implemented
- **Generic Interfaces**: IPowerManager, ISystemMonitor, IServiceManager in `include/platform/`
- **Platform Implementations**: Source files only in `src/platform/linux/` and `src/platform/windows/`
- **Compile-Time Selection**: Preprocessor directives ensure only target platform code is compiled
- **Windows Mock Support**: Complete mock implementations for Windows platform testing
- **Binary Optimization**: Linux binaries contain 45 Linux symbols, 0 Windows symbols (1.8M size)

### Platform Capabilities
1. **Get CPU Load**: `systemMonitor->getLoadAverages()` - cross-platform load monitoring
2. **Switch Mode**: `powerManager->setPerformanceMode()` / `setPowerSavingMode()` - unified power management  
3. **Install/Uninstall Service**: `serviceManager->installService()` / `uninstallService()` - service management

### Implementation Benefits
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: All platform selection happens at compile time
- **Optimal Binary Size**: No unused platform code included in binaries
- **Clean Architecture**: Application code only uses generic interfaces
- **Mock Testing**: Windows implementations log exact commands for future implementation
- **Maintainable**: Adding new platforms doesn't affect existing code

### Enhanced Load Monitoring Algorithm
- **Check Interval**: 30 seconds for responsive monitoring
- **Threshold Logic**: 
  - **1-minute load > 10%** → Switch to TLP AC mode (`tlp ac`)
  - **Both 5-minute AND 15-minute load ≤ 10%** → Switch to TLP battery mode (`tlp bat`)
  - **Overlap zone** (1-min ≤ 10% AND either 5-min > 10% OR 15-min > 10%) → Maintain current state
- **Load Average Source**: Reads 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute values from `/proc/loadavg`
- **Conservative Battery Switch**: Requires both medium-term (5-min) and long-term (15-min) low load

### Implementation Details
- **Load Average Parsing**: Modified to read 1-min, 5-min, and 15-min from `/proc/loadavg`
- **TLP Mode Selection**: Uses `setACMode()` and `setBatteryMode()` (not auto mode)
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Calculates absolute load threshold as 10% × core count
- **Enhanced Logging**: Shows 1-min, 5-min, and 15-min load averages with percentages
- **State Machine**: Intelligent switching logic prevents mode flapping
- **Conservative Approach**: Battery mode only when system is idle across multiple time scales

### Logging Format
```
[2025-07-03 20:45:30.123] [INFO] Initial state: 1-min load: 1.8 (22.5% avg per core), 5-min load: 0.9 (11.2% avg per core), 15-min load: 0.7 (8.8% avg per core)
[2025-07-03 20:45:30.124] [INFO] System active - switching to TLP AC mode
[2025-07-03 20:45:30.125] [INFO] Activity monitor started (1-min > 10% = AC mode, both 5-min AND 15-min <= 10% = battery mode)
[2025-07-03 20:46:00.456] [INFO] System became idle (5-min load: 1.1 = 13.7% avg per core <= 10% AND 15-min load: 0.8 = 10.0% avg per core <= 10%) - switching to TLP battery mode
```

## Recent Major Refactoring (Latest)

### Ultra-Simplification Complete ✅
- **Removed ALL Configuration**: Eliminated all config file support, parsing, and related code
- **Load Average Monitoring**: Switched from CPU usage to 1-minute load average from `/proc/loadavg`
- **Hardcoded Defaults**: All settings now hardcoded for maximum simplicity and reliability
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: System checks load average only once per minute (60-second intervals)
- **Config-Free Design**: No configuration files, no command-line parameters except --daemon, --help, --version

### Implementation Details
- **Load Threshold**: Hardcoded to 0.10 (10% of one CPU core)
- **Idle Timeout**: Hardcoded to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Check Interval**: Hardcoded to 60 seconds (1 minute)
- **Log File**: Hardcoded to `/var/log/ddotlp.log`
- **No Sampling**: Direct load average reading with no averaging or circular buffers

### Terminology Corrections ✅
- **TLP Auto Mode**: `tlp start` - correctly referred to as "auto mode" (not "performance mode")
- **TLP Battery Mode**: `tlp bat` - correctly referred to as "battery mode"
- **Accurate Logging**: All log messages now reflect TLP's actual mode names
- **Documentation**: README and help output updated to reflect correct TLP terminology

### Code Cleanup ✅
- **Function Naming**: Renamed `setPerformanceMode()` to `setAutoMode()` for accurate terminology
- **Mode Tracking**: Internal mode state uses "auto" and "battery" to match TLP's actual modes
- **Config Removal**: Deleted `config.cpp`, `config.h`, and entire `config/` directory
- **CMake Cleanup**: Removed all config file installation rules
- **Warning-Free Build**: All compiler warnings eliminated
- **Signal Handling**: Updated SIGHUP handling to reflect no-config design
- **Main Simplification**: Removed all config-related command-line options and parsing

### Final User-Facing Text Simplification ✅ (Latest Update)
- **Help Output**: Simplified help text to remove developer jargon like "Hardcoded settings"
- **Single Sentence Summary**: Help now shows "Automatically switches between TLP auto and battery modes based on system load"
- **README Cleanup**: Changed "hardcoded sensible defaults" to "works out of the box with sensible defaults"
- **Settings Section**: Renamed "Hardcoded Settings" to simply "Settings" in documentation
- **User-Friendly Language**: All user-facing text now uses clear, non-technical language

## Current Implementation Details

### Implementation Details
- **Load Average Source**: Reads 1-minute load average directly from `/proc/loadavg`
- **Core Count Detection**: Reads `/proc/cpuinfo` to count processor entries (no external commands)
- **Dynamic Threshold**: Calculates absolute load threshold as 10% × core count
- **Decision Logic**: Load average > (0.10 × cores) = active; load average ≤ (0.10 × cores) = idle
- **Check Frequency**: Every 60 seconds for minimal system impact
- **Immediate Response**: Mode switches immediately based on current load average (no idle timeout)
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only `/proc` filesystem, completely self-contained
