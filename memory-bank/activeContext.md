## Current Work Focus
**Project Status**: Cross-platform packaging enhancement completed
**Last Updated**: July 22, 2025
**Current State**: Windows MSI packaging via GitHub Actions implemented

## Recent Implementation: Windows MSI Packaging Support - COMPLETED

### Completed Task: GitHub Actions Windows MSI Package Generation
- **Issue Resolved**: Added comprehensive Windows MSI packaging to GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- **Problem Solved**: Only Linux packages (DEB, RPM, TGZ) were being built; Windows users had no installer option
- **Goal Achieved**: Full cross-platform package generation with Windows NSIS-based MSI installers

### Implementation Summary
- **Windows Build Pipeline**: Added complete Windows build jobs using windows-latest runners
- **NSIS Integration**: Enhanced CMakeLists.txt with comprehensive NSIS installer configuration
- **Cross-Platform CI/CD**: Split build jobs into Linux and Windows variants maintaining existing functionality
- **Package Validation**: Added Windows-specific package validation and testing steps
- **Release Integration**: Extended release artifacts to include Windows MSI, ZIP, and standalone executables

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Windows Jobs Added**: 
  - `build-windows` - Windows executable compilation using MSVC/MinGW
  - `test-windows` - Windows binary functionality testing
  - `package-windows` - NSIS installer and ZIP package creation
  - `validate-windows-installer`, `validate-windows-zip` - Windows package validation
- **Enhanced CMakeLists.txt**: Improved NSIS configuration with branding, service installation, optional icon support
- **Cross-Compilation Verified**: Successfully tested Windows executable generation using MinGW on Linux

### Package Outputs Added
- **Windows NSIS Installer**: `ddogreen-{version}-windows-installer.exe` - Full MSI-like installer with service registration
- **Windows ZIP Package**: `ddogreen-{version}-windows.zip` - Portable ZIP with all components
- **Windows Standalone Binary**: `ddogreen-{version}-windows-x64.exe` - Standalone executable
- **Maintained Linux Packages**: All existing DEB, RPM, TGZ packages continue to work

### Cross-Platform Build System Status
- **Linux Development**: CMake presets continue to work (`cmake --preset release`)
- **Windows Development**: build.ps1 PowerShell script for native Windows builds  
- **Cross-Compilation**: MinGW toolchain verified for Windows builds from Linux
- **Testing**: Both platform executables tested and validated

### Next Steps: Ready for Development
- **Development Environment**: Fully documented and aligned
- **Build System**: All workflows clearly specified and current
- **Testing Infrastructure**: GoogleTest integration properly documented
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform development well-defined
- **Documentation**: Memory bank accurately reflects project state

### Memory Bank Organization Reference
**IMPORTANT**: Follow content placement guidelines in `systemPatterns.md` â†’ "Memory Bank Organization Guidelines"
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and immediate context only
- **progress.md**: Completed achievements and milestones only
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture, patterns, and technical specifications
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and development environment
- **projectbrief.md**: Project scope and core requirements
- **productContext.md**: Business purpose and user value

## Current Priorities

### Immediate Focus: Memory Bank Alignment
- **Status**: Documentation cleanup in progress to match actual codebase
- **Architecture**: Verify platform abstraction still matches implementation
- **Build System**: Update all references to use correct CMake preset + build.ps1 workflow
- **Documentation**: Ensure memory bank accurately reflects current state
- **Testing**: Verify current test infrastructure and documentation

### Technical Context

### Current Technical State
- **Platform Abstraction**: Clean separation verified and current
- **Build System**: CMake presets for Linux development, build.ps1 for Windows  
- **Testing Infrastructure**: GoogleTest integration available via BUILD_TESTS=ON
- **Version Strategy**: Development builds show 0.0.0, production releases use git tags
- **Documentation**: Memory bank properly aligned with actual implementation
