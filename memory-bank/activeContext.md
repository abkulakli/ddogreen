### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): Windows installer.bat Directory Creation Fix
**COMPLETED**: Fixed false "Failed to create directory" errors in installer script
- **Issue**: `mkdir` command returning non-zero exit codes even when directories were successfully created
- **Root Cause**: Windows mkdir can return error codes when directory already exists or in certain edge cases
- **Solution**: Changed error detection from checking `%errorlevel%` to verifying directory existence:
  ```batch
  # Before: mkdir "%DIR%" && if %errorlevel% neq 0 error
  # After:  mkdir "%DIR%" 2>nul && if not exist "%DIR%" error
  ```
- **Result**: Installer no longer shows false "Failed to create directory" errors
- **Areas Fixed**: Both program directory and configuration directory creation

### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): Windows installer.bat Script Fixes
**COMPLETED**: Fixed multiple issues in Windows ZIP package installer script
- **Issue 1**: Admin privilege check was not stopping script execution properly
  - **Root Cause**: `%errorlevel%` handling in complex batch if-statements 
  - **Solution**: Changed from `if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b` to `call :check_admin || exit /b 1`
  - **Result**: Script now properly stops when not run as Administrator

- **Issue 2**: NSSM service installation command was malformed
  - **Root Cause**: Passing ddogreen arguments directly to NSSM install command
  - **Solution**: Split into separate commands:
    - `nssm install service executable` 
    - `nssm set service AppParameters "--config file"`
  - **Result**: Proper NSSM service configuration

- **Issue 3**: NSSM binary path detection was not robust
  - **Root Cause**: Hardcoded `bin\nssm.exe` path assumption
  - **Solution**: Added dynamic path detection similar to ddogreen.exe detection
  - **Result**: Works with both nested and flat ZIP structures

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ `--help` and `--status` commands work correctly
- ✅ Admin privilege check properly stops execution with clear error message
- ✅ NSSM and ddogreen.exe path detection works with current ZIP structure
- ⏳ Full service installation testing requires Administrator privileges

### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): Windows ZIP Package Structure Fix
**COMPLETED**: Fixed nested folder issue in Windows ZIP packages
- **Issue**: ZIP file contained unnecessary `ddogreen-windows/` top-level folder
- **User Impact**: Users had to navigate into nested folder after extraction
- **Solution**: Added `CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY OFF` to CMakeLists.txt
- **Result**: ZIP now extracts files directly to proper structure:
  ```
  ddogreen-windows.zip
  ├── bin/
  │   ├── ddogreen.exe
  │   └── nssm.exe
  ├── share/ddogreen/
  │   └── ddogreen.conf.default
  └── installer.bat
  ```
- **Benefit**: Improved user experience with cleaner extraction structure

### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): GitHub Actions Custom ZIP Removal
**COMPLETED**: Removed redundant custom ZIP creation from GitHub Actions workflow
- **Issue**: Workflow had both CMake-generated ZIP (via CPack) and custom PowerShell ZIP creation
- **Solution**: Removed custom ZIP creation section, now using only CMake's native ZIP packaging
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplified CI/CD pipeline with fewer steps
  - Consistent packaging approach using CMake across all platforms
  - Reduced complexity and potential for packaging inconsistencies
  - Single source of truth for package structure via CMakeLists.txt

  - `.github/workflows/unified-ci-cd.yml` - Removed custom ZIP creation steps
  - `memory-bank/cicdPipeline.md` - Updated documentation to reflect CMake-only approach

**ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT**: Single CMake-Based Packaging
- **Windows**: CMake CPack generates both ZIP and MSI packages consistently
- **ZIP Generation**: Uses CMake install rules and CPACK_GENERATOR="ZIP;WIX"
- **MSI Generation**: Uses WiX toolset integration through CMake
- **Consistency**: All packaging now follows CMake's standardized structure
- **Validation**: Both ZIP and MSI packages validated in CI with same test criteria

### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): Windows Service Installation Fix
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: ddogreen console application cannot run as native Windows service
- **Root Cause**: ddogreen is designed as modern foreground application (like systemd Type=simple)
- **Windows Problem**: Both MSI and ZIP installers use `sc create` expecting native Windows service interface
- **Architecture Gap**: Application lacks ServiceMain/ServiceCtrlHandler required for Windows SCM

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: NSSM Service Wrapper Integration
- **Approach**: Bundle NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) with Windows installers
- **Benefits**: Maintains clean console application architecture while enabling Windows service deployment
- **Files Updated**:
  - `packaging/windows/zip/installer.bat` - Updated to use NSSM for service creation
  - `packaging/windows/msi/ddogreen.wxs` - Added NSSM custom actions for MSI installer
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - Added NSSM.exe to Windows package installation
  - `packaging/windows/nssm/nssm.exe` - Added NSSM 2.24 (331KB) to deployment

**PROGRESS STATUS**:
- ✅ ZIP Package: NSSM integration complete, builds successfully
- ✅ Service Creation: Service installs via NSSM without errors
- 🔄 Service Startup: Service starts but requires privilege verification
- ⏳ MSI Package: WiX syntax fixes in progress for custom actions

### Latest Update (Aug 12, 2025): Complete Platform Abstraction Achievement + Test Fix
**COMPLETED**: Achieved complete platform abstraction architecture with zero `#ifdef` in common code
- **Platform Abstraction Enforcement**: Established strict architectural rule - NO `#ifdef` directives allowed in common/application code
- **Signal Handling Platform Layer**: Replaced direct platform-specific code with clean ISignalHandler abstraction
- **Test Platform Compliance**: Fixed test that was incorrectly hardcoded for Linux paths - now properly platform-aware
- **Architecture Validation**: All 26 tests now passing (100% success rate) with proper platform abstraction
- **Quality Achievement**:
  - Zero platform-specific code in main.cpp or any common application code
  - All platform dependencies isolated in dedicated platform layer
  - Clean interfaces for all cross-platform functionality
  - Compile-time platform selection via factory pattern
  - Runtime platform detection with proper error handling

### Platform Abstraction Enforcement Policy
**STRICT RULE**: No `#ifdef` preprocessor directives allowed in common/application code
- **Allowed Locations**: Platform-specific implementation files only (`src/platform/[platform]/`)
- **Allowed Usage**: Factory pattern for compile-time platform selection in `platform_factory.cpp`
- **Common Code Rule**: Application layer (`main.cpp`, `config.cpp`, `logger.cpp`, etc.) must use ONLY abstract interfaces
- **Interface Pattern**: All platform functionality accessed through abstract base classes:
  - `ISystemMonitor` - System load monitoring
  - `IPowerManager` - Power management control
  - `IPlatformUtils` - Path resolution, privilege checking
  - `ISignalHandler` - Signal handling and graceful shutdown
- **Factory Creation**: Platform-specific objects created via `PlatformFactory::create*()` methods
- **Benefits**: Complete platform abstraction, easier testing, cleaner architecture, better maintainability

### Complete Signal Handling Abstraction (Aug 12, 2025)
**COMPLETED**: Full platform abstraction for signal handling with zero common code dependencies
- **New Files Created**:
  - `include/platform/isignal_handler.h` - Clean abstract interface
  - `src/platform/windows/windows_signal_handler.cpp` - Windows implementation
  - `src/platform/linux/linux_signal_handler.cpp` - Linux implementation
  - `src/platform/macos/macos_signal_handler.cpp` - macOS implementation
- **ISignalHandler Interface**:
  ```cpp
  class ISignalHandler {
      virtual void setupSignalHandlers() = 0;
      virtual bool shouldRun() = 0;
      virtual void waitForSignal() = 0;
  };
  ```
- **Platform Implementations**:
  - **Windows**: `SetConsoleCtrlHandler()` for console control events (CTRL_C, CTRL_BREAK, CTRL_CLOSE, CTRL_SHUTDOWN)
  - **Linux**: Standard `signal()` handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT with atomic boolean coordination
  - **macOS**: Unix-style signal handling (same pattern as Linux)
- **Factory Integration**: Added `PlatformFactory::createSignalHandler()` with compile-time platform selection
- **Main.cpp Cleanup**: Removed ALL platform-specific includes and #ifdef blocks - now purely abstract interface usage

### Test Platform Abstraction Fix (Aug 12, 2025)
**COMPLETED**: Fixed platform-specific test that was violating abstraction principles
- **Issue**: Test `test_get_default_config_path_returns_platform_specific_path` was hardcoded for Linux paths
- **Problem**: Test failed on Windows expecting `/etc/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf` but getting `C:\ProgramData\DDOSoft\ddogreen\ddogreen.conf`
- **Solution**: Made test platform-aware with proper conditional expectations:
  - Windows: Validates `DDOSoft` and `ddogreen` in path
  - Linux: Expects `/etc/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf`
  - macOS: Expects `/etc/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf`
- **Result**: All 26 tests now pass (100% success rate) across all platforms
- **Architecture Compliance**: Test now properly validates platform-specific behavior while using platform abstraction

### Previous Update (Aug 12, 2025): Complete Daemon Infrastructure Removal
**COMPLETED**: Removed all daemon-related infrastructure and source files
- **Removed Files**:
  - `include/daemon.h` and `src/daemon.cpp` (main daemon wrapper)
  - `include/platform/idaemon.h` and `src/platform/idaemon.cpp` (interface)
  - All platform-specific daemon implementations (linux_daemon.cpp, windows_daemon.cpp, macos_daemon.cpp)
- **Simplified Signal Handling**: Replaced complex daemon abstraction with direct platform-specific signal handling in main.cpp
  - Windows: `SetConsoleCtrlHandler()` for console control events
  - Unix/Linux: Standard `signal()` handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT
  - Global atomic bool flag for clean shutdown coordination
- **Updated Build System**: Removed daemon source files from CMakeLists.txt and test configurations
- **Fixed Windows Installer**: Removed incorrect `--daemon` flag reference from Windows ZIP installer script
- **Architecture Benefits**:
  - Eliminated ~400+ lines of complex platform abstraction code
  - Simplified signal handling without performance overhead
  - Reduced binary size and compilation complexity
  - Direct, clear signal management without abstraction layers
- **Build Status**: All builds successful, application functionality preserved

### Previous Update (Aug 11, 2025): Removed --daemon Flag - Modern Service Architecture
**COMPLETED**: Modernized application to use contemporary service management patterns
- **Removed**: `--daemon` flag and self-daemonization logic (~200 lines of platform-specific code)
- **Architecture**: Applications run in foreground; service managers handle backgrounding
- **Linux Services**: Changed from `Type=forking` to `Type=simple` in systemd service files
- **Windows Services**: Removed `--daemon` from MSI service configuration
- **Benefits**:
  - Simpler, more reliable code
  - Better process supervision by service managers
  - Easier debugging (foreground by default)
  - Modern best practices alignment

  - Windows MSI: Updated service arguments to remove `--daemon`
  - Documentation: Updated README to reflect new service-first approach
- **Testing**: Application builds successfully, help shows updated options, rejects old `--daemon` flag

### Process Update (Aug 12, 2025): Enhanced Response Approach  
- **Thoughtful Response Principle**: Added explicit instruction to prioritize thinking and correctness over speed
- **Question-First Approach**: Reinforced importance of asking clarifying questions when requests are unclear
- **Quality Over Speed**: Established principle that accuracy and completeness take priority over rapid responses
- **Deep Analysis**: Emphasized taking time to understand context, implications, and optimal solutions before acting

### Process Update (Aug 8, 2025): Clarifying Questions for Vague Prompts
- Added explicit policy to Copilot instructions: when a request is vague, ask 1–3 targeted clarifying questions or proceed with 1–2 stated assumptions when safe. This improves accuracy without blocking on low-risk defaults.

### Process Update (Aug 8, 2025): No Workarounds Principle
- Added strict policy to avoid workaround/hacky fixes. Always prefer root-cause, long-term solutions aligned with architecture and standards. If blocked, ask targeted questions or outline the correct solution path—do not ship hacks.

### Process Update (Aug 8, 2025): Memory Bank Governance
- Clarified memory bank usage: only durable facts (decisions, standards, interfaces, patterns). No workaround content, no ephemeral notes/logs/secrets. Workarounds, if explicitly requested, are not recorded; only the proper solution path is documented once implemented.

### Previous Update (Aug 8, 2025): MSI installs Windows Service and removes it on uninstall
- Moved WiX ServiceInstall/ServiceControl into the component that installs `ddogreen.exe` so the service is correctly bound to the executable (WiX rule: service must be in same component as its file).
- Service behavior:
  - Installs and configures service `ddogreen` (auto start, LocalSystem).
  - Starts service at the end of install; stops on upgrade/uninstall; removes service before files are removed.
  - Passes arguments: `--config "[CONFIGFOLDER]ddogreen.conf"` ensuring it uses the installed config at `%ProgramData%\DDOSoft\ddogreen\ddogreen.conf`.
- Result: Clean install/upgrade/uninstall flow; no orphaned service entries; config present before service start (StartServices occurs after InstallFiles).

## Latest Activity: GitHub Actions MSI Integration - COMPLETED

### Documentation Alignment (August 8, 2025)
- Updated README to be user-focused: current CLI (-d, -c, -h, -v), installer-managed services (Linux systemd via packages, Windows MSI/ZIP), required configuration and default paths.
- Removed outdated --install/--uninstall flags from README and aligned monitoring/status guidance.
- Adjusted main.cpp logs to be platform-agnostic (generic power management backend messages).

### Completed Task: CI/CD Pipeline MSI Support (August 4, 2025)
- **Activity**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow to build and release MSI packages
- **Scope**: Added WiX v5 installation, MSI generation, and release artifact handling
- **Result**: CI/CD pipeline now automatically generates both ZIP and MSI packages for Windows
- **Quality**: MSI packages included in GitHub releases with proper installation instructions

## Previous Critical Finding: Memory Bank Documentation Inconsistencies - RESOLVED

### Previous Critical Finding: Memory Bank Documentation Inconsistencies - RESOLVED

**Original Issue**: Memory bank incorrectly documented that package structure standardization was completed, when actually mixed implementation existed.

**Resolution**: Implemented true standardization by adopting `share/ddogreen` consistently across all platforms, making the memory bank claims accurate.

**Evidence of Resolution**:
```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt (UPDATED CODE)
install(FILES "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/config/ddogreen.conf.default"
        DESTINATION share/ddogreen)  # ← Now consistent for all platforms!
```

**Package Verification**:
```bash
$ tar -tzf ddogreen-linux.tar.gz
ddogreen-linux/share/ddogreen/ddogreen.conf.default  # ✅ Standardized structure
```

**Impact**: Memory bank documentation now accurately reflects actual implementation.

## Previous Implementation: Windows Real CPU Queue Length Implementation - COMPLETED

### Completed Task: Removed Mock Implementation and Added Real Processor Queue Length
- **Issue Resolved**: Windows system monitor used mock/fake data instead of real processor queue monitoring
- **Problem Solved**: CPU usage percentage conversion was inaccurate substitute for load average; mock implementation provided fake data
- **Goal Achieved**: True Windows load average equivalent using processor queue length performance counters

### Implementation Summary
- **Mock Code Removal**: Completely removed all mock/fake implementations from Windows system monitor
- **Real Queue Length**: Implemented `getCurrentQueueLength()` using Windows Performance Counter `\System\Processor Queue Length`
- **Performance Enhancement**: Removed unnecessary 1-second sleep from CPU monitoring for better responsiveness
- **Load Average Accuracy**: Direct use of processor queue length instead of CPU percentage conversion for accurate load measurement

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Files Modified**: `src/platform/windows/windows_system_monitor.cpp`
- **New Performance Counter**: Added `\System\Processor Queue Length` counter for real queue monitoring
- **Method Changes**:
  - `initializeCpuMonitoring()`: Added processor queue length counter initialization
  - `getCurrentQueueLength()`: New method for real processor queue length monitoring
  - `getLoadAverage()`: Updated to use real queue length instead of CPU percentage
  - `getCurrentCpuUsage()`: Removed 1-second sleep and mock implementation
  - `getCpuCoreCountInternal()`: Removed mock fallback implementation
- **Architecture Compliance**: Maintained platform abstraction while improving Windows-specific implementation quality

### Windows Performance Counter Integration
- **Primary Counter**: `\System\Processor Queue Length` - Direct equivalent to Linux load average
- **Secondary Counter**: `\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time` - Maintained for potential future use
- **Performance Data Collection**: Single PDH query collecting both counters efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all PDH operations with debug logging

## Previous Implementation: Platform Abstraction Refinement - COMPLETED

### Completed Task: Removed Linux-specific unistd.h from main.cpp
- **Issue Resolved**: main.cpp included unistd.h which is Linux-only, breaking Windows portability
- **Problem Solved**: Unnecessary platform-specific header in core application layer violated clean architecture
- **Goal Achieved**: True platform-agnostic main.cpp with all platform dependencies properly abstracted

### Implementation Summary
- **Header Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary `#include <unistd.h>` from main.cpp
- **Architecture Verification**: Confirmed main.cpp uses no unistd.h functions directly
- **Platform Separation**: Verified unistd.h usage is properly contained in Linux/macOS platform implementations
- **Windows Compatibility**: Ensured main.cpp can compile cleanly on Windows without conditional compilation

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Files Modified**: `src/main.cpp` - removed unistd.h include
- **Platform Headers Verified**:
  - Linux/macOS implementations: Properly use `#include <unistd.h>`
  - Windows implementations: Properly use `#include <windows.h>`
  - Main application: Only standard C++ headers
- **Build Verification**: Debug build completed successfully after change
- **Architecture Compliance**: Zero platform-specific code in main application layer maintained

### Cross-Platform Architecture Status
- **Clean Separation**: Platform-specific code isolated to src/platform/{linux,windows,macos}/
- **Interface Abstractions**: All platform operations go through IPlatformUtils, IPowerManager, etc.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Only used in platform factory and platform implementations
- **Header Management**: Platform-specific headers contained within their respective implementations
